# CompSci_144_Project

This was my project for Computer Science 144 (1st Year Second Semester)
It was a really fun project to do and got to work with interfaces and OOP.
This project is basically a spell checker which takes in a text file containing all words that can be found in a desired dictionary.
It then can be used to check for spelling errors and give you a top n suggestions of words that you maybe wanted to use.
Was definitely a good learning experience
10/10 Lots of headaches and late nights. Would code this again.
